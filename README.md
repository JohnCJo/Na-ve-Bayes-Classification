# Na-ve-Bayes-ClassificationProblem Statement
Write a program to learn a na√Øve Bayes classifier and use it to predict class labels of test
data. Laplacian smoothing should be used. The learned classifier should be tested on
test instances and the accuracy of prediction for the test instances should be printed as
output. A single program should train the classifier on the training set as well as test it on
the test set.
Data Set Description:
The task is to predict whether a citizen is happy to live in a city based on certain
parameters
of the city as rated by the citizens on a scale of 1-5 during a survey.
Attribute Information:
D = decision/class attribute (D) with values 0 (unhappy) and 1 (happy) (Column 1 of file)
X1 = the availability of information about the city services (Column 2 of file)
X2 = the cost of housing
X3 = the overall quality of public schools
X4 = your trust in the local police
X5 = the maintenance of streets and sidewalks
X6 = the availability of social community events
Attributes X1 to X6 have values 1 to 5.

Submission Instructions:
(1) Code your program without using any library/module meant for machine learning or
deep learning.other than numpy and pandas.
(2) Do the same experiment by using some library such as Sci-kit Learn or Seaborn
(Use the notebook file to experiment with the code)
